// What is Node js

->> Node js is runtime environment for javascript
--> Node we can run javascript outside to  the browser.
-> Like Server,window,mac,linux etc
->> JavaScript run inside the browser

// Where we need JS outside browser

--> Web Browser Run on client computer.
--> So JavaScript do not handle things on server.
--> So we can not connect javascript with database directly
--> Can not handle File System etc
--> So we have to run javascript on browser and Node help for this.

there is many language like php , java , python but
Why we need Node

--> Unified Language
--> High Performance
--> Good for Real time Application
--> Good for data Structure
etc

How to use it full stack and FE technology
--> We make API in node js.
--> Integrated APIs with FE technology.
--> BE+FE=Full Stack


History of Node js

--> First release - May 27,2009
--> written in js, c, c++




REPL --> Read Evaluate Print Loop

// What is Server Side and client side scripting ????
 --> Server where the code is put
 --> Client where the website access

jo server par aa kar execute hoti hai vo server side scripting like php,java
jo client par aa kar execute hoti hai vo client side scripting like javascript

Node js javascrpt ko server side scripting language bana deta hai




// What we Exactly Do with Node JS
--> Node js is mostly used fopr API(Application Programming Interface) development
---> API sends and receives data between any two language.
--> After make API in node js , API can use in front technologies,Mobile technologies and any other platform

CORE MODULES AND GLOBAL OBJECT IN NODE

module is a block of code to achieve a specific functionality

TYPES OF MODULES :--
1)- Core modules:- jo pehle se install hote hai
2) Third party modules : jo externally install karte hai
3) custom module : jo  khud se bana saktee hai


Global Object is an object that is available in all modules by default.
You do not need to import or require it to use it.
Console is a global object;


Diff b/w console.log in js and node js

Used for	Frontend debugging	Backend debugging
DOM access	✅ Yes	            ❌ No

CREATE SERVERS IN NODE JS

// INTERVIEW QUESTION
//
// Ques ---> How to create server ?
//     by using http.createserver
//
// Ques->  server kis core package ki help se create karte hai
// -->  by usinng http
//
//
// Ques -->how to end response .
//     what is req and resp;

//
// Ques: can we create multiple servers?
//     yes






// EXTERNAL PACKAGE AND PACKAGE.json

External package or external module or third party module
We use npm i to restore  the node_modules if deleted

how to install package json --> npm init
why node_modules is not push in git --> bcz it is a heavy folder having a large space



// NODEMON PACKAGE(Nodemon Package)

with the help of nodemon package we will run the application or server in continuously

 ques : what is nodemon package
// ques: server ko regularly run karna chahte hai ya phir file ko baar baar start nahi karna chahte to konsa package use karenge
Ques: Why we use '-' or hyphen in installing the npm packages??

 is used to when u want to  install the packages at the global level and it also used to save the dependencies and dev-dependencies.
 -g se package globally install hota hai



Hyphen (-) in npm is used for passing command options (flags) and for clean, readable package & script names.




// UNDERSTAND SERVER RESPONSE

What is server response?
--> when client request to the server then sever reponse , in response there is some data that is visible on browser called sever reponse.



// Ques --> how we exit with any request ??
//     resp.end();
// Ques-> how we exit whole process??
//      --> process.exit();



// Make Sample API
 --> Define Static API Data
 --> Use this data in server response
 --> Check API data
 --> Test API with thunder client



// Understand Client Request


Ques- What is Client request?
  -->


 // Get Input from CMD in Node js


 // LOAD HTML FILE
 200/201 shows good
 500 shows error
