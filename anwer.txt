1. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous file operations?

    ---> Synchronous blocks execution until completion, while asynchronous runs in
     the background without blocking.

2. When should you use file streams instead of reading the entire file?

    ---> We use the file streams when the file is large or needs to be processed
    gradually without loading it full into the memory.


3. Explain the purpose of the ‘utf8’ encoding parameter in file operations.

   --->  The 'utf8' encoding parameters tell the system to read or write the file as
   human-readable text (Unicode Character) instead of raw binary data , so text is
   correctly interpreted.

4. What are the common error codes in file system operations and what do they mean?

   --->  In **Node.js**, common file system error codes and their meanings are:

         // ENOENT - File or directory does not exist
         // EACCES - Permission denied
         // EEXIST - File already exists
         // EISDIR - Expected file but found directory
         // ENOTDIR - Expected directory but found file

         These errors are usually found in `err.code` when using the `fs` module.


5. How would you safely delete a directory with all its contents?

   ---> In node js , we use -> fs.rm(path,{recurisve: true, force: true }) to safely
   delete a directory and all its contents.

6. Explain the concept of piping in streams with an example.

   ---> Piping in streams means sending data directly from one stream into another
   without manual handling
   Piping connects a readable stream to a writable stream automatically


7. Why is it important to handle errors in file operations?

   ---> It's important to handle errors in file operations to prevent crashes
   avoid data loss and ensures the application responds safely to issues like meaning
   files ,permissions problems , or disk failures.

   Proper error handling is crucial for robust file system operations.


8. What is the difference between writeFile and appendFile methods?

   ---> In writeFile replace's the file content with the old content ,
   while appendFile adds new data in the old content without  deleting.
